## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find valuable information and examples here.

## Data Structures

### Heap

- **Overview**: A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property (min-heap or max-heap).
- **Implementation**: Code examples and explanations on how to implement heaps in various programming languages.

### Binary Tree

- **Overview**: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
- **Traversal Methods**: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, and Level Order.
- **Implementation**: Detailed examples of binary tree operations.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Search Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and more.
